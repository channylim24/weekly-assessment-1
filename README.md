<!-- 1. What questions would you have when see that design? -->
<!-- What should I do to turn this design into a website interface, how can I make it responsive to the device screen size -->

<!-- 2. What considerations would you need to take to implement all features seen in design? -->
<!-- I need to considerate on writing a good html structure so it might help me easier to design it -->

<!-- 3. What obstacles or challenges might you encounter when coding this design? -->
<!-- How to display it prettily on both devices, also there are some pictures with portrait and landscape position so I think it's gonna be challenging for me, and I think giving it the exact same box shadow would also be challenging since I'm not at that level yet  -->

<!-- 4. How would you implement the design to make similar as the mock up? -->
<!-- I need to analyze from the biggest part to the smallest part, so I can write a neat html structure and I need to learn every size and position of each containers and design them so they can look similar to the prototype-->
